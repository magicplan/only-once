# Only Once

Ever needed to securely share a password with someone? Here you go!
`OnlyOnce` by magicplan is an easy way to share secret messages with one recipient.

Once you entered a message, the data gets encrypted. The encryption key is only displayed to you and is not stored anywhere.
You now can share the generated link with your recipient. Once they accessed the message, it's deleted.

You can try out a hosted version on [https://only-once.magicplan.dev](https://only-once.magicplan.dev).
